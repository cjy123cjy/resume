\section{\faLightbulbO\ characteristics}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Fast-learner and individually learning. Fill the skill stack since the company doesn't have a mature mentor system. Always curious about the technologies and keep learning.
  \item Being accurate. The ability to sharing the ideas with partners via the common terms. Seeking the simple \& well-tested code in the promise of the on scheduled project process.
  \item Project Management Ability. Always Project-driven, arrange the milestone for the project stages reasonably. Balance the tasks between different roles of the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{\faCogs\ Skills}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Rear-end: Golang, Java, Shell, Node.js
  \item Frontend: React
  \item Others: Mysql, Redis, Docker, Kafka, Kubernetes
  \item OS: Linux
  \item Languages: English - Fluent, Mandarin - Native speaker
\end{itemize}

\section{\faUsers\ Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Iplusmobot Tech.} Zhejiang, China}{May. 2021 -- Present}
\role{\textbf{Rear-end develop}}\\
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Responsible for many important R\&D and on-site projects of the company, including the 10-ton outdoor heavy-load AMR project, BYD battery factory project and others.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{China Academy of Machinery Science \& Technology}, Zhejiang, China}{Apr. 2020 -- Apr. 2021}
\role{\textbf{Rear-end develop}}\\
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Machine tool cloud serve software development with SpringBoot.
\end{itemize}

\section{\faFile\ Projects}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{BYD's battery factory project}}{}
Responsibilities: Rear-end Development \& Operation
\\Updating the vehicle-used battery production line for BYD's factory.
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Using Go-kratos microservice for rear-end code development.
  \item Choosing Redis for cache, and Mysql for database.
  \item Building the full CI/CD route with Docker -> Gitlab-Runner -> K8S
\end{itemize}
Deliverables: 800+ AGVs were successfully delivered, and the peak QPS each day is about 1000 ~ 2000. The gross profit is more than 40 million RMB at this project.


\datedsubsection{\textbf{Multi-Robot Scheduling Algorithm Testing Tool}}{}
Responsibilities: Project Leader
\\Building tests in batches to verify the feasibility of the scheduling algorithm.
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item The simulation of schedule layer: imported the k-mean and AHC algorithms, and developed the business layer and AGV layer with Golang;
  \item The simulation of batch test: Set up a virtual machine cluster with Proxmox. Developed a toolchain based on Golang and Shell. Testing the robot schedule algorithm and collecting data.
\end{itemize}
Deliverables: During the integration test stage, more than 80\% of the scheduling algorithm risks were checked in advance, saving approximately 40\% of the man-hours for on-site scheduling and debugging.


\datedsubsection{\textbf{Remote Driving Project}}{}
Responsibilities: Project Leader
\\Remotely controlling the 10-ton-level outdoor heavy-load AGV with real-time video \& control stream.
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.5ex]
  \item Teleoperation terminal: Using the steer wheel as the input signal, and receiving the signal with the node.js script.
  \item Video terminal: Developed SpringBoot rear-end based on the fragile-mp4 format. Then for optimizing the latency of video stream, changed to the C++ rear-end based on the WebRTC format.
  \item Others: Using Zerotier for intranet penetration, and using http and Websocket terminal communications.
\end{itemize}
Deliverables: The outdoor AGVs are all pre-installed with this system.
